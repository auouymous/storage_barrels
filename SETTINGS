storage_barrels_height = 0.95
	- height should not be changed after barrels have been placed in the world, unless entities are disabled
	- can be 0.25 to 1.0

storage_barrels_disable_entities = false
	- entities look nice, but they increase memory usage, lag server and reduce client FPS
		- this is okay for single player but large servers should turn them off or increase cost of barrels
	- if barrels have been placed in world:
		- turning entities ON requires refreshing every barrel with the barrel mover
		- turning entities OFF leaves behind unknown entities which can be punched to remove them
	- issues:
		- entities can be killed with /clearobjects - right-click with an empty barrel mover to recreate the entity
		- entities can only be seen upto 48 nodes away, could be less on servers
		- entities take time to appear when loading an area
