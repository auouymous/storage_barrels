Minetest Storage-Barrels Mod
==========

Small barrels hold 3000 items of same type, large barrels hold 99,999 items of same type and creative barrels hold infinite items of same type.
Liquid barrels hold 100 buckets of same type and creative liquid barrels hold infinite buckets of same type.
Locked and creative barrels can only be accessed by the player who placed them.
Protected barrels can only be accessed by players who have access to the area.

Barrels can be placed on floor, ceiling or walls (magic prevents your items from falling out).
Barrels can be rotated with a screwdriver, left click to rotate around axis, right click to change axis.
Liquid barrels can only be oriented with opening on top (ran out of magic).
There is a small mark on the opening to indicate orientation.

* Right-click:
	* With item or filled bucket in hand:
		* If barrel is empty or has same item/liquid, insert the entire stack or bucket in hand.
	* With empty hand:
		* Find all items/buckets in inventory of barrel type and insert them.
* Left-click:
	* If item barrel:
		* Get one item from barrel.
		* If sneaking, get up to one stack from barrel.
	* If Liquid barrel and empty bucket in hand:
		* Fill bucket from barrel.

Barrels can't be broken while they contain items or liquid.
Barrels are locked to an item/liquid, even when empty, and must be replaced to change type.



Barrel Mover
==========

Sneak left-clicking a barrel picks it up and right-clicking places it back down.
Right-clicking a barrel mover on a barrel will recreate it's item/liquid entity, if it was somehow removed.
